# Leaf-species-detection-using-Decision-Tree
The project investigates the use of Decision Tree algorithms for accurately identifying leaf species using the Iris dataset, a crucial tool for understanding biodiversity, ecosystem dynamics, and environmental impacts, and explores their potential applications in botany and related fields
The dataset used for training and testing the Decision Tree model is the Iris dataset, a widely-used dataset in machine learning for classification tasks.
Description:
The Iris dataset consists of samples of iris flowers, where each sample represents a different iris flower.
Each sample includes measurements of four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.
These measurements are in centimeters and are used to characterize the morphology of the iris flowers.
Target Variable:
The target variable in the Iris dataset represents the species of the iris flowers.
There are three species of iris flowers in the dataset: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.
The target variable is categorical, with each category representing one of the three species.
Size of the Dataset:
Number of Samples: The dataset consists of a total of 150 samples of iris flowers.
Number of Attributes: Each sample has four attributes (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width) used as features for classification.
Hence, the size of the dataset is 150 samples x 4 attributes.

Conclusion:
The Iris dataset was used to predict the species of iris flowers using a decision tree model. The model's predictive power was assessed using feature importance scores, which showed that petal length was the most important feature for distinguishing between iris species. The study highlights the importance of decision trees in leaf species detection and their potential applications in fields like botany, ecology, agriculture, and environmental conservation. However, the study has limitations, such as the small size of the Iris dataset and potential overfitting issues. Despite these, the study highlights the utility of decision tree models in leaf species detection and suggests that as technology advances, the application of machine learning in leaf species detection will grow, offering new insights and solutions to address environmental and agricultural challenges.
